      <h2> The Goal </h2>
      <p>
        We are working with Hegemony Tech, a startup that is building an app called SwingRow that tracks various metrics of a competition rowboat. By generating data, rowers and their coaches can gain more insight into ways to improve their rowing technique. Since smartphones are already ubiquitous in today's society, Hegemony aims to build an app that is readily available and cheap for rowers at any level. All sensors and computations must therefore be self-contained within the smartphone. For now, we focus on the iPhone framework and on a single-rower configuration. Later, Hegemony hopes to extrapolate this to other boat configurations and smartphone platforms.
      </p>

      <h2> The Problem </h2>
      <p>
        Rowers are primarily concerned with maximizing the speed of their boat and the distance they can cover in each stroke. For this reason, we focus on increasing the accuracy of these two metrics. The GPS from the iPhone samples about once every three seconds, so there is not enough resolution to see what happens within a stroke (which takes about 2 seconds). The accelerometer has an acceptable sampling frequency of 100 Hz, but since rowers are interested in speed and position, it must be integrated or double integrated which introduces a steep low-frequency drift.

      </div>

      <h2> The Solution </h2>
      <p>
        It turns out that the GPS and accelerometer signals are quite complementary to each other. The GPS maintains a relatively accurate average speed over many strokes but does not give the resolution within a single stroke. The accelerometer, on the other hand, provides high resolution information but its average speed drifts off very quickly. We have built two filters - a complementary and a Kalman filter - which combine the two data streams to create a more accurate estimate of distance and speed.
