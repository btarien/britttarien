        <h1> Hello! </h1>
        <p>
          My name is Britt. I recently graduated from the University of California at Davis with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. I plan to pursue a graduate program in Europe next Fall to further develop my skills in mechanical engineering. I have a particular interest in robotics and autonomy.<br/><br/>

          Outside of work and academics, I like to ski. I grew up skiing in the Lake Tahoe area since I was 9 years old. I started competing in slalom and giant slalom events at the age of 11. In college, I was the president of the alpine ski team. Now, I just like to get up there as often as possible in the winter before global warming takes all the snow away. <br/><br/>

          I created this website as a way to share my projects.
